         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving lately received from you, by the hands of my loving Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and Friend M<hi rend="sup">ris</hi>. <hi>Ducker,</hi> a booke undeÅ¿erved and unexpected favour,
one of your laÅ¿t bookes, intituled, <hi>Innocencie and Truth triumphing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
I acknowledge it a juÅ¿t engagement of obliged gratitude, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
accordingly, I doe here returne you deÅ¿erved and moÅ¿t humble
thankes for the Å¿ame, by the Å¿ame friendly hand. And becauÅ¿e (worthy Sir) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and conÅ¿idered with my Å¿elfe, that you Å¿ent it by way of love and deÅ¿ire to
give mee (who am, as I acknowledge, a poore and unworthy <hi>Presbyterian</hi>) Å¿atiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
if it might bee, touching your Independent Church-way: I having now
peruÅ¿ed it all over, even <hi>Ã  capite ad calcem</hi> (and I hope with that pietie and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie,
as my God hath enabled mee, which becomes a ChriÅ¿tian and fellow-Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to the Å¿ame Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t with you) I therefore hope you will, not Å¿o
much pardon (which I pray not) as accept (which I heartily deÅ¿ire) with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tian
Candor, mine ingenuitie and plaine dealing with you, in now giving you an
account, briefely, as I thought it moÅ¿t fit, of what light or content and Å¿atisfaction
I have received from it. Truely Sir, I having read your <hi>EpiÅ¿tle to the Reader,</hi> found
therein very full and faire promiÅ¿e of your ingenuous ayme and intention in the Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿equent
diÅ¿courÅ¿e, <hi>viz.</hi> that you projected foure things therein, <hi>Brevitie, PerÅ¿picuitie,
Moderation</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> But having, I Å¿ay, puruÅ¿ed your Booke, truely Sir, (if
I am not miÅ¿taken, as I beleeve I am not) you have come extreame Å¿hort of your
promiÅ¿ed project, in every of the foure branches thereof. For firÅ¿t, if I found you
<hi>Å¿hort,</hi> I am Å¿ure I found you <hi>Å¿harpe and tart;</hi> For <hi>PerÅ¿picuitie,</hi> I aÅ¿Å¿ure you I found
much <hi>cloudie obÅ¿curitie; Veri Å¿imilitudinem multam, non ipÅ¿am veritatem; Å¿atisfaction,</hi>
therefore none at all. But eÅ¿pecially, in that of projected <hi>moderation,</hi> and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed
temperature in writing, (the great defect, and foule fault, Å¿o cryed out upon
by Independents againÅ¿t all <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Writers or Speakers) in Å¿tead of <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
I found abundance of <hi>bitterneÅ¿Å¿e</hi> and <hi>unÅ¿avory jerkes and jeers</hi> (the light iÅ¿Å¿ues,
mee thought, rather of a youthfull <hi>green-head,</hi> than the Å¿olid expreÅ¿Å¿ions of a
<hi>grave heart</hi>) Å¿prinkled, almoÅ¿t, over all your whole diÅ¿courÅ¿e; which I muÅ¿t con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿Å¿e,
much troubled and affected mee with wonder to meet with, after Å¿uch a Å¿ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
promiÅ¿e of <hi>moderation:</hi> Some few of very many whereof (becauÅ¿e I knew,
<hi>DoloÅ¿us verÅ¿atur in generalibus</hi>) I have here particularized with their pages where
they are evidently and eaÅ¿ily to bee Å¿eene. As firÅ¿t, (to omit your <hi>Via Sanguinea,</hi>
with all its moÅ¿t bitter and biting, yea Å¿orely wounding expoÅ¿itions of that terme,
in your <hi>Theomachia, &amp;c.) Pag.</hi> 13. you compare Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> in his Reply, to <hi>the
two falÅ¿e witneÅ¿Å¿es,</hi> who falÅ¿ely accuÅ¿ed our bleÅ¿Å¿ed Saviour. And in the Å¿ame
Page you tell the Reader, <hi>Here Mr. Prynne vapours</hi> in his Reply; and immediatly
after, in the Å¿ame page how notably doe you jeere and Å¿coffe him about <hi>three Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles?</hi>
And with what an <hi>elated Å¿pirit</hi> doe you anÅ¿wer him, page 16. line 4. toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>a downe-right jeere about a Nationall Church,</hi> Å¿ome 12. lines after? You
alÅ¿o <hi>groÅ¿Å¿ely tax him with errors,</hi> Page 17. Sect. 21. And Page 18. and 19. you fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
jeere him, and among thoÅ¿e jeeres you tell him, <hi>that Acts 15. is onely Mr.
Prynnes GoÅ¿pel;</hi> what <hi>a bitter and unchriÅ¿tian cenÅ¿ure</hi> lay you upon him, and all
Presbyterians, Page 24. Sect. 26. towards the end of it? And Ã´ how you <hi>jeere him
with his quotations,</hi> Page 37. towards the bottome; as alÅ¿o Page 49. and Page 51.
<hi>you Å¿lander him with want of ReaÅ¿on and Truth</hi> too; and Page 52. you tell him, <hi>his pen
Å¿pits black reproaches in the face of Independents.</hi> You alÅ¿o accuÅ¿e him (Page 65.) <hi>of much
untruth;</hi> and <hi>the Å¿ame alÅ¿o</hi> againe moÅ¿t fouly, Page 84. Together with a <hi>Notable jeere,
exalting your Å¿elfe, and vilifying Mr. Prynne,</hi> which I have noted at large in your
booke, Page 85. Together with very many other Å¿uch like expreÅ¿Å¿ions, too tedious
to bee here recited; And yet (Å¿trange to conÅ¿ider) you conclude them all (with the
concluÅ¿ion of your booke) Page 99. <hi>in a hortatorie way to Mr. Prynne</hi> in theÅ¿e
<pb facs="tcp:162557:2"/>
words: <hi>That hee would put leÅ¿Å¿e Vinegar and Gall into his Inke, and more Wooll and Cotten.</hi>
And in the ApoÅ¿tles words, <hi>EpheÅ¿. 4. 31. That all bitterneÅ¿Å¿e and evill Å¿peaking bee put away,
as becomes Brethren.</hi> And now any impartiall perÅ¿on may judge whether you your Å¿elfe
have followed this <hi>brotherly exhortation;</hi> Nay, whether contrariwiÅ¿e, you have not
with <hi>unbrotherly aÅ¿perÅ¿ions,</hi> indeavoured to <hi>beÅ¿meare the face</hi> of that precious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
moÅ¿t worthy ever to bee honored both by <hi>you all</hi> and <hi>us all?</hi> Truely Sir, you
Independent Gentlemen have dealt with this moÅ¿t worthy Å¿ervant of the Lord, juÅ¿t
as the people of <hi>LyÅ¿tra</hi> did with the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Paul,</hi> whom at firÅ¿t they Å¿o honored
and admired, as that they were ready to deifie him and make him a God; but Å¿hort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after they furiouÅ¿ly indeavored to Å¿tone him to death: So yee, at the firÅ¿t, in the
time of <hi>Mr. Prynnes</hi> firÅ¿t moÅ¿t elaborate and learned <hi>divine writings,</hi> yea and for his
moÅ¿t glorious and <hi>Saint-like Å¿ufferings;</hi> O then, how yee all (with us) moÅ¿t highly
(and that moÅ¿t juÅ¿tly too) honored him, and brought him home from baniÅ¿hment,
as it were in the triumphing Chariot of your love and prayÅ¿es! But now, Å¿ince hee hath
piouÅ¿ly and faithfully written againÅ¿t your Independent way, and onely for this, O
how have <hi>you</hi> and almoÅ¿t <hi>all of your way,</hi> indeavored as much as in you is, to Å¿tone
to death his illuÅ¿trious reputation, by moÅ¿t unworthy and unchriÅ¿tian <hi>reviling</hi> and <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipending</hi>
of him, both in <hi>words</hi> and <hi>writings!</hi> Even him I Å¿ay, who for his pietie,
humilitie, incomparable conÅ¿tancy, fortitude and magnanimitie in Å¿uffering for <hi>GoÅ¿pel
Truths,</hi> was not inferiour to any of his moÅ¿t faithfull fellow-Å¿ufferers, yea, whoÅ¿e
Å¿oundneÅ¿Å¿e and Å¿inceritie, whoÅ¿e profound learning and indefatigable labours in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon deepeÅ¿t points of Divinitie and controverted <hi>GoÅ¿pel Truths</hi> (witneÅ¿Å¿e his
<hi>Perpetuitie of the eÅ¿tate of a regenerate man;</hi> his <hi>Anti-ArminianiÅ¿me, UnbiÅ¿hoping of
Timothy and Titus,</hi> his <hi>HiÅ¿trio-MaÅ¿tix;</hi> and many other his later, moÅ¿t learned, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox
and <hi>precious peeces</hi>) have made his never-dying name and fame moÅ¿t wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
renowned both in England and other parts of the world, beyond the Seas. And
yet this noble Gentleman to bee thus, I Å¿ay, <hi>beÅ¿meared</hi> and <hi>beÅ¿pattred</hi> with your <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juÅ¿t
accuÅ¿ations,</hi> onely I Å¿ay againe, for writing the Truth againÅ¿t <hi>Independent novelties;</hi>
O! it is moÅ¿t Å¿ad and bad to conÅ¿ider. Truely Sir, you muÅ¿t here give mee leave to bee
yet more plaine with you, I profeÅ¿Å¿e in the Å¿inceritie of my Å¿oule, that I doe moÅ¿t
groundedly beleeve, that (had <hi>Mr. Prynne</hi> beene Å¿uch a <hi>Non-Å¿enÅ¿e, ConÅ¿cienceleÅ¿Å¿e, Irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall,
falÅ¿e</hi> and <hi>frivolous writer,</hi> as <hi>you</hi> and <hi>others</hi> of your way onely have Å¿trugled
(but all in vaine) to make and demonÅ¿trate him by your <hi>laviÅ¿h tongues</hi> and <hi>pens</hi>) that
yet, I Å¿ay certainly, <hi>Mr. John Goodwin</hi> was the moÅ¿t unfit man of all I know in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
to lay thoÅ¿e undeÅ¿erved <hi>criminations</hi> to <hi>Mr. Prynnes</hi> charge. For, you know good
Sir, that <hi>Qui in alterum paratus eÅ¿t dicere, ipÅ¿um vitio carere oportet.</hi> For you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Reverend Sir, to take upon you to tax <hi>Mr. Prynne</hi> of <hi>errours, untruths,</hi> and
<hi>Å¿uch like,</hi> as you have done, it was Å¿urely moÅ¿t abÅ¿urd and unbeÅ¿eeming you: for it is too
well knowne, how deepely you your Å¿elf (before ever this moÅ¿t <hi>unhappy</hi> and <hi>unholy</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of <hi>Independency</hi> with <hi>Presbytery</hi> was dream'd of) have beene cenÅ¿ured both of
<hi>SocinianiÅ¿me;</hi> (and how juÅ¿tly too, others have moÅ¿t learnedly in publick declared)
and more lately alÅ¿o how you have beene diÅ¿covered to hold a moÅ¿t <hi>dangerous,</hi> yea
<hi>a moÅ¿t damnable opinion</hi> (as a learned <hi>Independent brother</hi> of yours termed it in my
hearing, and who then Å¿aid hee would juÅ¿tifie it againÅ¿t you) touching <hi>juÅ¿tifying
Faith by ChriÅ¿t.</hi> And now alÅ¿o, how fiercely you are fallen on this unhappily diÅ¿tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant
<hi>new way of Independencie.</hi> I beÅ¿eech you therefore, Reverend Sir, Å¿eriouÅ¿ly to
conÅ¿ider theÅ¿e things, to muÅ¿ter up your Å¿addeÅ¿t thoughts, and to Å¿ee into what a
<hi>Labyrinth</hi> you are Å¿trangely and Å¿trongly intricated. Sir, I doe not, I cannot denie, but
ingenuouÅ¿ly confeÅ¿Å¿e that God hath given you much learning and eminent parts, but
truely Sir, if I bee not miÅ¿taken, I greatly feare, your <hi>Independent ProÅ¿elytes</hi> doe
too much magnifie, if not (almoÅ¿t) deifie you for them, and as it was with <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi>
his Scholars, an <hi>IpÅ¿e dixit</hi> is enough, I, feare for <hi>many,</hi> if not <hi>moÅ¿t</hi> of your
diÅ¿ciples, <hi>jurare in verba MagiÅ¿tri;</hi> Whereby I pray God, your great parts and gifts
bee not (thus) a great Snare to your Å¿oule, which I much feare, if not timely and
truely Å¿eene into and prevented by <hi>Cordiall Å¿elfe-denyall,</hi> and <hi>holy humilitie</hi> in <hi>your
<pb facs="tcp:162557:3"/>
Å¿elfe,</hi> being more <hi>kindly affectioned with brotherly love, and in honour preferring others
before your felfe, Rom.</hi> 12. 10. And thus (Reverend Sir) I have made humbly bold,
by your owne occaÅ¿ion, lovingly, and (I hope) fairely and friendly as a poore true
ChriÅ¿tian brother ought (<hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17.) <hi>Liberare animam meam,</hi> and thus to manifeÅ¿t
my reciprocall love and gratitude unto you, praying our good God it may bee accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the <hi>like right handed ChriÅ¿tian Candor,</hi> and <hi>Å¿implicitie</hi> of <hi>heart</hi> with which it is
